This was a project for a client, the client needed a quick mockup of an ecommerce store.  Currently, their website was outdated and needed a complete revamp.  

Her job was to create a marketing strategy to help boost their sales, their was a lot of points that needed to be addressed and one of those points was the website of their company.  Thus my role as a developer was to create a visually pleasing MVP of what it would look like if they decided to create the company in the form of an ecommerce store.
